# Fond Pattern Library

Storybook helps build UI components in isolation from the `platform (anyperk)` logic, data, and context.
This is threaded into the `anyperk-frontend` repo but is run as a separate process both in development
and when deployed.

Components are re-used and can have multiple looks/states. These variations can be seen all within the GUI
by saving these UI states as **stories** which will be listed below the component in the side nav.

1. **`.storybook`**: This directory contains Storybook's [configuration](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview) files.

2. **`public`**: This directory will contain the development and production build of the site.

3. **`src/common/components/:singleComponent`**: The directory of a component now has a `.stories` file

4. **`src/common/styles`**: This has not changed _BUT_ moving forward this will be only for global/common css _NOT_ specific to components

5. **`src/stories`**: All Storybook non-component stories/pages/mockups & markdown documentation

6. **`src/stories/readmes`**: All non-component markdown documentation

7. **`package.json`**: Added `scripts`, `devDependencies` & eslint override for `*.stories` files
